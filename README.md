Jane Street Kaggle Competition Notebook

This ipynb notebook file contains the work I did exploring the Jane Street Kaggle Competition.

I initially created my own workbook and did basic exploratory data analysis, but decided to copy and add on to another Kaggler's work, because of the fantastic visuals he created and my goal of learning how to display data in such a fashion.

I created an LSTM (long-short term memory) network, which is a branch of the neural networks that are so common in ML, but one that deals with the vanishing gradient issue, particular to time-series data.

It was a great process and I learned a ton.

Unfortunately, I spent all my time creating the model, and almost no time submitting to the Kaggle servers and subsequently my best submissions were too late, and I did not place very well at all.

But hopefully in the future, my work will be better, I will learn more, and I will do better in the competitions.
